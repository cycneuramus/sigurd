## Overview

Sigurd is an example chatbot for Signal built on the `[signalbot](https://github.com/filipre/signalbot)` framework. Features:

+ Responds quite rudely, especially to negative feedback (e.g. "You suck, Sigurd!").
+ Keeps quiet unless his name is mentioned, or unless he receives a `!` prefixed command.
+ Caches responses so as never to repeat himself.
+ Quotes random song lyrics on demand (e.g. `!lyrics Symphony X`).
+ Notifies you of new releases from [artists that you wish to track](bot/utils/spotify_data.py).
